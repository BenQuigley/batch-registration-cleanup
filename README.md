# Batch Registration Cleanup Report

A suite of scripts to be used as Informer scripted columns for a 
batch registration cleanup report for Berklee College of Music.

The Elective Check field was merged into the Min Credits Check field 
to avoid redundancy, since an elective is what is assigned to students 
who have their other classes but who still need more credits.
